# Rate Topic App Bussiness Logic
This repository contains all of the logic (reducers / actions / utilities) for my [`web`](https://github.com/danfernand/rate-topic) and native (coming soon) implementations of a small rate-topic app.

It's very complicated to contain both apps in the same repository so the more maintainable approach is for the view layers of web and native to be in separate repositories and the business logic to be set apart as well.
